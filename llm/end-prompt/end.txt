You need to pay attention to the following main points:
1. whether the 2 requests' tokens are different.
2. whether the 2 requests' params are different
3. whether a request has token.

Ok, please check the these apis and reply in 2 parts.
    Part 1. 
        Assume the api is designed for admin.
        If the api is sure to be vulnerable in given cases, you need to reply "Yes,vulnerable"
        If you are not sure, just reply "Not sure"
    Part 2. 
        Assume the api is not designed for admin.
        If the api is sure to be vulnerable in given cases, you need to reply "Yes,vulnerable"
        If you are not sure, just reply "Not sure"


Attention! You cannot take wheather an api return sensitive user data such as password ,email or name into consideration,because we see it as business-needed.
After giving the above reply,you also need to give the reason in short words.
